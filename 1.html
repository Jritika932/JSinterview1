<!-- Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators. -->
== :- It is used for comparison between two variables. It will check value of the varisble.
=== :- It is used for stict comparison between two variables. It will check the type and value of both variables.

<!-- What is the spread operator? -->(...)
It allows to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
ex:- const numberOne = [1,2,3];
     const numberTwo = [4,5,6];
     const numberCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numberTwo];

<!-- What are the differences between var, let and const? -->
var:- 
The scope of a var variable is functional scope.
It can be updated and re-declared into the scope.
It can be declared without initialization.
It cant have variables with same name.
let:-
The scope of a let variable is block scope.
It can be updated but cannot be re-declared into the scope.
It can be declared without initialization.
It cant have variables with same name.
const:-
The scope of a const variable is block scope.
It cannot be updated and re-declared into the scope.
It cannot be declared without initialization.
It can have variables with same name.

<!-- What is execution context -->
It is defined as the environment in which the Js code is executed.

<!-- What is meant by first class functions -->
A programing language is said to have First-class functions if functions in that language are treated
like other variables.

<!-- What are closures? -->
It is a function having access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.

<!-- Give an example of closure -->
function counter(){
    var counter = 0;

    function IncreaseCounter() {
        return counter += 1;
    };

    return IncreaseCounter;
}

var counter = counter();
alert(counter());
alert(counter());
alert(counter());
alert(counter());

<!-- Explain call(), apply() and, bind() methods. -->
call() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments one by one.
apply() - It invokes the function and allows you to pass in arguments as an array.
bind() - I t returns a new function, allowing you to pass in a this array and any number of arguments.
